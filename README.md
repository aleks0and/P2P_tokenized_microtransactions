# Product description 

Multi-platform smart contract solution to organize loans between people.

Many situations in our daily lives require us to split bills or to lend to people around us different sums of money. Nevertheless, in dealing with such transactions, several complications may arise, people can forget to pay or some may purposely keep the money, while asking for their money back might be social awkward for the lender.

By offering a multi-platform smart contract solution to organize loans between people, we are solving this problem. The solution will rely on transparency and collaboration between users to make the whole lending process simpler for them.

Users create an account and provide basic information via a mobile app or website, after which they can use our service. Account-holders will be able to create tokens that will represent outstanding debts and will close when both users confirm the debt is settled. Tokens will categorize the expenses, determine the split ratios and the exact amount to be paid, and determine the currency or some other payment vessel such as barter to repay the debt. 

We are building our token as an undeniable Proof-of-Transactions described as a physical thing that senses the process of transporting value from one location or object to another. With the help of PoT, we hope to reach a certain amount of social pressure between peers while at the same time remaining user-friendly.


## Workflow description 

For the development of the application, we have been using the extreme programming approach. This should explain the number of commits in the repository because we are a group of people who worked simultaneously on the code.

## Future development
During the development process of this project we came into couple of hurdles which we see as the future improvements:
- Changing string variables into bytes: According to the community bytes is much better structure to hold string variables and it uses much less resources.
- Updating the hashing function: We wanted to use combination of both addresses of the parties involved and the timestamp of the transaction. As we wanted to to receive a unique identifier for the operation, to further store it in our database for credit score evaluation. 
- Further integration for the front end: We provide just solidity file as well as the jupyter notebook file for the credit score evaluation. For the further development we wish to include the front-end for the app as designed in the application layout.
